# SoPra Project Group 22 Uno Extreme Server

## Introduction
We are a Team of 4 Students at the UZH of Zürich.
For the course Software Enginnering Lab we had to build a web app.
We wanted to make a fun project and therefore we decided to implement a game.
The game we choose is the popular game Uno Extreeme.

## Technologies
- gradle
- java 15
- spring boot
- Heroku
- Sonarcloud
## High Level Components
Game Conctroller

## High Level Components
Components:
- game 
- user
- lobby 
For each of the components there is a Repository, an entity, a Controller and a Service
- Repository: to store Entities, e.g. Userrepository
- Entities: Java classes representing database Tables
- Conroller: handle client requests and call services
- Service: Handling all the functionality (e.g. retrieve users, save data, change data, logic)


## Launch and Deployement
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>
